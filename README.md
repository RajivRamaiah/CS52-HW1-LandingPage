# Rajiv Ramaiah, CS52 HW1 Landing Page

For this assignment I used only CSS and HTML to create a landing page similar to that of Slack's landing page. It wasn't too hard to lay out the raw skeleton of the page, but using flexboxes to align the different categories of the website was tricky when combined with styling. I do think that my use of flexboxes to correctly align categories made it easier for the website to respond well on smaller screen sizes without having to use complex transformations or adjustments. I used transitions to add eye-catching effects to the Sign In button at the top right, the Create button in the middle of the screen, and the main text "From Markup to Startup..." when hovering over it.
